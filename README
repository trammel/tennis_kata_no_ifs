Goal
-----

The basic principle to calculate a tennis score. Easy.

To keep it simple, the tennis match only lasts for one game.

The game is turn based. Player one goes first, then player two.
Repeat until there is a winner.

At any time, you can check the score, it should be after a point has
been assigned.

When there is a winner, they should be declared and the game terminated.

BUT! You cannot use if's, unless's, case or other such flow control. Cheater.

Tests should be written first!
